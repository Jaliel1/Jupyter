To get Jupyter on an andoid device:
First of all, check to see if your device has enough storage, 3 GB.
Next, install Andronix from Google Play Store(pydoid3 is not available for the U.S.)
Open Andronix, download Termux from there(Termux in Google Play is depreciated and won't work).
When you have F-droid version of Termux installed, go back to Andronix and coose a distro.
I have found that Debian works the best.
After this is installed, type code: pkg install python3.
This will install pip, as well as a lot of other packages.
Type code: python -m pip install --upgrade pip.
Next, type code: python -m pip install jupyter. This will install jupyter notetbook.
As you will be in root, type code: jupyter notebook --allow-root.
When jupyter boots up, it will have two http addresses at the end,
you can use either one, but every time you start jupyter notebook, it will 
have a different token number.
Type this http address into your browser and now you're in jupyter.
